# Moonball Company Website

The fictional company website for a company with incredibly unclear motives.

I managed to get pretty close to the recreation of the example website, with my own changes to taste, such as adding a logo and making the text monospaced (I like the look, okay?).

I got tripped up on a few easy things but I'm not going to get upset over them (apart from the missing letter in one of the IDs that made one section's link not work which I gave up on and came back to multiple times before finding the issue).
I checked the website on my phone and it looks a complete mess, but since I'm only visiting it on desktop, I'll let it go for now. I assume there's stuff coming up that'll teach me best practices to make websites compatible with different screens.
